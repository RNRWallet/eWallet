- **CQRS & Event Sourcing**: Applying advanced architectural patterns for complex domains
- **Data Persistence**: Working with PostgreSQL, and Redis for various data needs

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Cloud Platform Engineering**: Designing and implementing GCP-based infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Deploying applications using Docker and Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure using Terraform and Helm
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automating build, test, and deployment processes
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring with Application Insights and Prometheus

### Security & Compliance

- **Identity Management**: Implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
- **API Security**: Securing APIs with proper authentication and authorization
