# ADR-003: .Quarkus for Cloud-Native Development

## Status

**Accepted** - August 2025

## Context

eHailing's microservices architecture requires sophisticated orchestration, service discovery, observability, and deployment capabilities. The development and operational challenges include:

- **Local Development Complexity**: Running and debugging multiple services simultaneously
- **Service Orchestration**: Managing dependencies and startup order across services
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing, logging, and metrics across service boundaries
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for multiple environments
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource allocation and service discovery
- **Cloud Deployment**: Streamlined deployment to cloud platforms with minimal configuration
- **Development Experience**: Simplified developer onboarding and productivity

Traditional approaches would require significant custom infrastructure code, multiple configuration files, and complex setup procedures that would hinder development velocity and system maintainability.

## Decision

Adopt Quarkus as the cloud-native development framework to provide integrated service orchestration, observability, and deployment capabilities for the eHailing microservices ecosystem.
